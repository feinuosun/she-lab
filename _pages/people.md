I am a postdoctoral fellow at the [Global Aging and Community Intiative](https://globalagingandcommunity.com), Mount Saint Vincent University, Canada, working for the NIH-funded R01 project [Demography of Chronic Pain](https://globalagingandcommunity.com/projects/demography-of-aging-and-pain/) with Drs. Zachary Zimmer, Anna Zajacova, and Hanna Grol-Prokopczyk, and also one of the 2021-2022 fellow of the [Consortium on Analytics for Data-Driven Decision-Making (CAnD3)](https://www.mcgill.ca/cand3/), Mcgill University, Canada. I am on the 2022-2023 academic job market.

My research interests are in **demography of health**, **rural-urban health disparities**, **pain and pain management**, **quantitative methods**, and **spatial analysis**. My work addresses questions about social determinants of population health outcomes (e.g, pain) based on both the individual and ecological level analysis. Some of my research has appeared in **Social Science & Medicine**, **Annals of Epidemiology**, **Population, Space and Place**, **Chinese Sociological Review**, and **Demographic Research**.

I obtained my Ph.D.in Sociology at the University at Albany, State University of New York with a graduate certificate in Demography in 2021. Before that, I received my bachelor's degree in Transportation Engineering from Sountheast University, Nanjing, China in 2015 and a bachelor's degree in Administrative Management (Self Examination) from Nanjing University, China.
