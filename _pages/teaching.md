I apply the [Team-Based Learning (TBL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team-based_learning) approach in my teaching. I have three years of experiences in instructing a variety of undergraduate level courses such as *Introduction to Social Research* and *Introduction to Sociology*. I was a co-instructor for the course *Statistics for Sociologists*. I also have some experiences in serving as a guest speaker for graduate level courses.
