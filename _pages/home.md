excerpt: 
  "Welcome to the Spatial Health Equity (SHE) lab led by Dr. Feinuo Sun! We are dedicated to addressing spatial disparities in population health outcomes, with a particular focus on chronic pain and its associated consequences such as disability and substance addiction. Our current research aims to understanding the multifaceted spatial dimensions (e.g., rural/urban, natural environments, policies and neighborhood characteristics) that shape pain disparities at both individual and ecological levels."
