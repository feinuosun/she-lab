## CAnD3
My CAnD3 goals are:
1. Improve substantive knowledge in aging and population health.
2. Improve methodological knowledge on data-driven research (e.g., Python language).
3. Learn about the skills and tips for communications with the general public. 
4. Learn about how to showcase experiences and qualifications to potential employers.

## Public writing
In 2017, I published a short communication [The Abandoned Rural Farms Threatening Chinaâ€™s Food Security](https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1000538/the-abandoned-rural-farms-threatening-chinas-food-security) based on my research on land use in China in *Six Tone*, an online magazine by the Shanghai United Media Group for international readers.
