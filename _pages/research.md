Our research fits in the broad framework of social determinants of health (SDOH). The framework incorporates *demographic characteristics* (i.e., age, sex, and race), *socioeconomic status* (e.g., education and income), *interpersonal relationships* (e.g., family arrangements and social networks), *natural, built, and social environments* (e.g., place-based characteristics, such as rural-urban residence), as well as *societal contexts* (e.g., policies, laws, and social norms). I study how these factors shape health disparities at both the individual and ecological levels. 
Our current research is mainly about the **spatial/geographic dimension** (the largest two levels in the SDOH framework) of chronic pain outcomes among older adults.

## Rural-Urban Difference in Chronic Pain of Older Adults
The burden of pain can be particularly high in rural areas due to the disproportionate shares of older and poorer health people and healthcare shortages compared to urban areas. The  pilot project fills the gap by examining the rural-urban and within-rural disparities in pain prevalence and how compositional and contextual factors explain these disparities. We use individual-level data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) linked with neighborhood-level data from the census, American Community Survey, National Neighborhood Data Archive, and Rural-Urban Commuting Area codes. The project aims to answer two questions: 1) How does the prevalence of pain differ across the rural-urban continuum? 2) How do neighborhood demographic composition and socioenvironmental characteristics explain the disparities in the prevalence of pain? The findings would be critical for policymaking and resource allocation to address health disparities and promote healthy aging. 

## State-Level Policies and Chronic Pain
Research on the geography of chronic pain outcomes mostly used cross-sectional data from a single year, and discussions on the impacts of sociopolitical contexts are limited. This study is among the first to examine the developing trends of arthritis pain outcomes and the policy determinants, based on state-level panel data constructed from datasets such as the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and State Policy & Politics Database.

## Natural Environments and Chronic Pain
The goal of this project is to understand how natural-environmental conditions of neighborhoods shape pain outcomes among older adults. The aims include: 1) how long-term, even lifetime exposure, to environmental hazards through the life course shapes pain disparities among older adults; 2) how neighborhood environmental hazards shape pain outcomes differently for different groups.
