My research fits in the framework of social determinants of population health outcomes. The framework incorporates *demographic characteristics* (e.g., age, sex, and race), *SES* (e.g., education and income), *interpersonal relationships* (e.g., family arrangements and social networks), *community environments* (e.g., rural-urban inequality, residential segregation, and the availability of healthcare resources), as well as *societal contexts* (e.g., social norms, laws, and policies). I study how these factors shape health disparities at both the individual and ecological level.

My past and ongoing research projects cover a variety of health outcomes including pain and pain-related conditions, opioid crisis outcomes, COVID-19 outcomes, and others. 

## Pain and pain-related conditions

### How long can people live w/o pain?

### How does pain predict disability?

### How pain distributes geographically?

## Opioid crisis

### Opioid prescribing

### Opioid mortality

## COVID-19

## Other measures of health
